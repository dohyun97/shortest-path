# shortest-path
Problem Description:
A city is laid out as a rectangular grid as you see in the figure below, where the first intersection at
bottom left is identified as (0,0) and the top right intersection as (n-1, m-1). In this figure the number
of the east-west and north-south streets is 8 (i.e. n = 8, m = 8).
A self driving car, which is left at a random intersection, is given the instruction to drive to a particular
intersection. The car should be able to find the shortest path from the source intersection to the
destination intersection. It is assumed that intersections have an equal distance from each other
